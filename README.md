# Pandas.Matplotlib.Pylab.Seaborn
Data visualization

0 Load into pandas any dataset that has at least a couple of numeric columns and at least one categorical column with a small number of categories. Describe your data, what each column means, what type (categorical, real, integer, binary) this column is, if necessary for categorical including binary attributes give decoding of their values. In general, do a "visual" analysis of your data.

1 Matplotlib

1.1 Construct any graph (of any kind) using pure matplotlib / pylab

1.2 Build multiple subplots on the same graph using .subplot.

The graphs must be of different types and at least two of them must be linked to your dataset. In at least one graph, sign the axes. In all graphs, sign the name of the graph.

2 Based on your dataset, build three different types of graphs using pandas.DataFrame.plot / Series.plot (manual) Among the graphs there must be one boxplot (be sure to use the by parameter, to investigate the relationship between a numeric variable and some other variable). The plots must be plotted using both DataFrame and Series methods. That is, both variants must be demonstrated.

3 Seaborn.

3.1 Construct a .pairplot using seaborn on some dataset by analyzing the relationship of a set of numeric variables

3.2 Construct a .jointplot by analyzing the relationship between two specific numeric variables

3.3 Construct a .boxplot or .violinplot on any dataset by analyzing some numerical variable in terms of categorical

3.4 Plot a heatmap plot of the pairwise correlation of all numeric variables (remove the categorical variables from the plot)

4 Construct any graph (related to your data) using plotly
